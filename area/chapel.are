Mi-Go, the Fungi from Yuggoth ... it is a pinkish being about five feet long;
with a crustaceous body bearing a vast pair of membranous wings and several
sets of articulate limbs, body a sort of convoluted ellipsoid, covered with
multitudes of very small antennae, where a head would ordinarily be.  These
beings sometimes walk on all their legs and sometimes on the hind pair only.

... shocking and uncouth black thing with smooth, oily, skin, unpleasant horns
that curve inward toward each other, bat wings whose beating make no sound,
ugly prehensile paws, and a barbed tail that lashes disquietingly.  And worst
of all, it makes absolutely no sound or speech and smiles not at all because
it has no face, only a suggestive blackness where a face ought to be ...

The hunting horror~
The hunting horror is here in wait of an unwary traveler.
~
Serving Nyarlathotep and Roch'tar, these beings are hunting for victims.
They resemble enormous ropy black serpents or worms possessing bat-like or
umbrella-like wings.  Their forms continually shift and change, twitching
and writhing, so it is hard to look at them.  They speak in great harsh
voices.  A hunting horror is HUGE, normally around 40 feet long.

It stands approximately 8 feet tall and hunches over to fit in this
small room.  It has a pair of tremendous claws that it uses to rip and tear.
It has dog-like face except ... different.  Bright glowing eyes and a grimace
lead you to believe that he knew that you were coming.

softly into the air:

    The forces of evil have unlocked my spirit as

    calls me but I am blocked from its quiet.

Quite insane, the mad etcher has been here for two decades.  His hair is
white; he babbles nonsense to himself; a layer of dust covers his out-of-date
clothing; and he seems to be working on the same portion of the wall near
the base ... oh and he seems quite blind.

He leers insanely at you and says 'heh heh what can I do for you children?
Please don't mind my wife, she is always like that ... hello dear can you
make some tea for our company?  Oh good!  Now sit right down will you?
Would you like hot or cold tea?  Yes the weather is ...'

And on he babbles ...

You can barely make her out ... though it almost makes you vomit.
She is missing half her head.  The remaining half is smashed in horribly like
she took a nasty fall.  Her one damaged eye hangs on its own.  She smiles
insanely at you thru a broken jaw and missing teeth.  One hand of hers is
resting on the shoulder of the etcher ... her husband.

Entrance Chamber to the Grand Hall of Kings~
Whoever built this place must have been very rich indeed!  Though you did
enter through a rather small door this place has enough room to hold several
score of people.  The floor has a beautifully woven carpet, and the walls are
covered in finely crafted tapestries. You can tell that these things must have
been worth much but they have not lasted well throughout the ages.  Massive
doors lead off to the south and a large stone staircase leads up.

The Shrine of Crotus~
Mostly rubble, this place used to be the shrine of the famous king Crotus,
who saved the northern regions from being overrun by the goblin hordes of
100 years ago.  If not for him, Midgaard of course would have eventually been
conquered as well.  Though Crotus was a goodly king, it was rumored that he
turned to the dark ways in his dying years ... and died an evil man.

The Shrine of Mitnar~
Mitnar was a gruesome beast of a man ... he loved battle ... and nothing
else.  Warriors did love Mitnar, and all fighting men honored him.
On the wall is depicted battle after battle after battle.
A small opening has been shaped carefully to the east.

and weapons under the feet of Mitnar.  Where his coffin was, there is now
only a rectangular blemish on the floor of the dusty room.
